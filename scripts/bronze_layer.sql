-- Building Bronze Layer

/*
Step 01: Analyzing (Interview source system expert)
	Before building bronze layer, we have to understand the source system. its better to get understanding of source system from source system expert
	and ask them many many questions in order to understand the nature of source system.
	
Step 02: Coding (Data Ingestion)
	Find a way how to load data from source to datawarehouse. 

Step 03: Data Validation (Data Completeness & Schema Checks)
	Its very important in the bronze layer to check the data completeness, so we have to compare the number od records between source system and the bronze
	layer just to make sure we are not losing any data in between.
	Other check is Schema check, that make sure that the data is placed on the right position.

Step 04: Docs and Version (Data documenting & versioning in git.)
